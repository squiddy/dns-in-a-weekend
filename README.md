# DNS in a weekend

Following https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/

## Material I found useful

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035
* https://veykril.github.io/tlborm/introduction.html

## TODO

This is of course very far from complete, but these are the things I want to
look into in the future.

- [ ] support ipv6
- [ ] properly handle CNAMEs in `resolve`
- [ ] split code into lib and binary
- [ ] make this a DNS server
